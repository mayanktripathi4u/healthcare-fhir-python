    "# Bundles Resource and Transactions Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets suppose you want to send a lot of resources together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's say an IOT device wants to send the observation for a patient along with the patient resource. \n",
    "We don't want this IOT device to be making multiple API calls to the REST server just to get information about the patient. So we have something called the Bundle and in specific we have the transaction type bundle which solves this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `FHIR` Bundle resource of type transaction allows you to add (create), edit (update), or delete multiple resources in a single request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry in the bundle specifies the operation (`POST` for add, `PUT` for edit, `DELETE` for remove) and the target resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "All operations are processed together atomicallyâ€”either all succeed or all fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the `resourceType` field specifies that this is a Bundle resource. The `type` field is set to transaction, meaning all included operations will be processed together atomically. The `entry` array contains the individual resources you want to process, and each entry includes a `request` object that defines the HTTP `method` (POST, PUT, or DELETE) and the target resource for the operation.\n",

    "# FHIR Bundle Resource\n",
    "A `Bundle` in FHIR is a container for a group of resources. It allows you to send, receive, or store multiple FHIR resources together in a single package. Bundles are commonly used for batch operations, search results, or transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Bundles\n",
    "Bundles have different types, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* document: A collection of resources as a clinical document.\n",
    "* message: A set of resources sent as a message.\n",
    "* searchset: Results from a search query.\n",
    "* transaction: A group of resources to be processed as a single atomic transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Type Bundle\n",
    "A transaction type bundle is used when you want the server to process all the resources in the bundle as a single atomic operation. This means either all operations succeed, or none do (rollback on failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use case:\n",
    "Suppose an IoT device wants to send both a new Patient resource and an Observation for that patient. Instead of making two separate API calls, it can send both resources in a single transaction bundle. The server will create both resources together, ensuring consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"resourceType\": \"Bundle\",\n",
    "  \"type\": \"transaction\",\n",
    "  \"entry\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"resource\": {\n",
    "        \"resourceType\": \"Patient\",\n",
    "        \"name\": [{ \"family\": \"Smith\", \"given\": [\"John\"] }]\n",
    "      },\n",
    "      \"request\": {\n",
    "        \"method\": \"POST\",\n",
    "        \"url\": \"Patient\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"resource\": {\n",
    "        \"resourceType\": \"Observation\",\n",
    "        \"status\": \"final\",\n",
    "        \"code\": { \"text\": \"Heart Rate\" },\n",
    "        \"subject\": { \"reference\": \"Patient/1\" }\n",
